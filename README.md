# smalltensor

Inspired by [minitorch](https://minitorch.github.io) and [tinygrad](https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad), `smalltensor` is a toy implementation of an basic deep learning framework, with Tensor and Autograd engine.

As a learning project, its aims to be simple, readable and build from the ground up with few dependencies. 

## Install
Require Python version 3.8 or above.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:hbhungg/smalltensor.git
cd smalltensor
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

## Examples
Example usage and training can be found at [\examples](https://github.com/hbhungg/smalltensor/tree/main/examples).

## TODOs:
 - Package as PyPi.
 - Create our own backend (no longer depend on numpy)! Good exercise.
 - Conv2d.
